"""
Docker-based E2E tests for Request Mirroring with Envoy.

These tests use Docker Compose to spin up Envoy with request mirroring
configured, then verify that requests are properly mirrored to shadow backend.

Feature 6: Request Mirroring / Traffic Shadowing

Test Scenarios:
1. 100% mirroring to shadow backend (/api/v1)
2. 50% sampling rate (/api/v2)
3. No mirroring baseline (/api/v3)

Requirements:
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- pytest (pip install pytest requests)

Run with:
    pytest tests/test_envoy_mirroring_e2e.py -v -s
